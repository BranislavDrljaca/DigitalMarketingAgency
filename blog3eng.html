    			<p style="color: black; text-align: center;"><h3 align="justify"><strong>Visual marketing </strong> 
                
                <br><br>Visual marketing involves the use of visual forms such as photos, infographics, videos and other similar forms to present a particular product or service. Visual content and textual content are inseparable, but they need to be well combined in order for your brand message to be well formulated and properly presented to your audience.
                 <br><br>Textual content is certainly the best basis for marketing, because it is necessary to create good and useful content that will give people a certain value. However, if you want to lead your audience to a certain type of interaction and ultimately convert them into customers, visual content must be part of your marketing strategy.
                 <br><br>The fight for the attention of the audience has never been harder if we keep in mind that the average attention of Internet users lasts only eight seconds. If you set the goal of your promotion on social networks to interact with your audience, then you will first have to gain and then keep their attention. One of the best ways to do this is quality and efficient visual content, because people learn visually, and process visual content up to 60,000 times faster than textual content.
                 
         <br><br>    <strong>  1. Brand your social media presence</strong>  
         <br><br> It is very important that you plan your brand's visual identity well so that your audience gets a good first impression. This primarily means creating an appropriate quality logo by which your products and services will be recognizable. People form an impression in the first milliseconds, so it is necessary that the profile and cover photo are in line with the colors and elements of your visual identity, since that is the first thing someone sees when they visit your Facebook page or Instagram account. You also need to make sure that your visual identity is consistent on different social networks in order to increase the recognition of your brand.
         <br><br>    <strong>  2. Publish quality photos</strong>    
         <br><br> Photos are the basis of visual content on social networks. It is important that the photos you use for the promotion are of good quality and look professional. Stock photos are mostly used on social networks, because their use does not require much time, considering that there are many sites that represent a diverse source of free photos. However, when using free stock photos, there is a danger that your competition will use them for its promotion, which you certainly do not want. In addition, your audience may get bored with this type of content, because these are mostly similar visuals, which your followers have already seen somewhere.
<br><br>
<strong>This is why it would be ideal if you used original photos</strong> This way you will be unique and stand out from your competition. You can hire a professional photographer who will take professional and unique photos that will attract your audience, which will pay off many times over.
<br><br>
<strong>Additional advice:</strong> If you do not have the time or money to create original photos for your promotion and still decide to use stock photos, it would be good to enrich them and set them apart by creating a template frame in which to insert them and publish as such. Make the template in accordance with the elements and colors of your brand, which will make general stock photos more unique.
  <br><br>     
       <strong>  3. Record video content intended for social networks</strong>    
                
       <br><br>  Visual content and videos go together like a needle and thread. Video is the most important aspect of visual content. Many marketing experts single it out as one of the best ways to promote on social media. As it represents a combination of sound, image and text, it is visually appealing and stands out from other forms of visual representation.
 <br><br>
However, when creating it, you should pay attention to a few things. It is necessary to optimize each video and adapt it to the platform on which it will be published. It is necessary for it to be effective in order to catch the audience's attention at the very beginning, because the video is played automatically on Facebook, so it is necessary to interest the audience to continue watching the video. The video must not be boring and must be relevant to your brand and your ongoing campaign.            
                
              <br><br>     
       <strong>  4. Use infographics</strong>       
                
            <br><br> Statistics no longer have to be boring if you present them in the right way. Infographics are a great tool for that. With them, you can present a large amount of information to your audience in a clear and interesting way.
 <br><br>
If we look at the fact that 65% of people learn better visually, then it is certain that by using infographics you will be able to educate the target audience more effectively and give a certain value. However, when creating them, you must be careful to create attractive visual content that your audience will click on and share. Infographics need to contain some important information that is relevant to your brand.
 <br><br>
If you feel that you are not ready enough to create your own video, and you want to share some important information with your audience, you can easily present it through a beautifully designed infographic.
 <br><br>
Whichever of these forms you choose for your presentation, your presence on social networks will be much more efficient, but it certainly depends on the type of data you want to share. You can use a variety of free online platforms like Canva to easily create infographics.      
          
           <br><br>     
       <strong>  5. Create original MEME posts</strong>        
            <br><br> MEME posts are pictures or photos with descriptions that are fun or ironic. On the one hand, they are like internal jokes and MEME announcements actually look at some current events and trends in a fun way. They are an increasingly popular form of expression on social media and are a great way to attract the attention of your audience, even if your post goes viral.
<br><br>  
However, in order for your MEME post to best present your product or service, you need to pay attention to certain things. Ideally, you should create original MEME posts in line with your brand vision and goals. If your target audience is an older population, they may not understand your joke, since MEME posts are mostly created and shared by a younger population. 
<br><br> 
In any case, meme posts should not replace the original content, but only serve as an addition to your marketing strategy to attract the attention of your audience.

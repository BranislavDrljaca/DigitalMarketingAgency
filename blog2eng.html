    			<p style="color: black; text-align: center;"><h3 align="justify">
    			<div align="justify"><strong>What exactly is storytelling?</strong>
                <br><br>The term storytelling in modern marketing implies a methodology for designing quality brand stories, their efficient distribution to potential clients / followers and listening to their reactions, in order to define the brand strategy even more precisely.
 <br><br>Some will say that modern marketing is actually a subtle flirtation, or more precisely, flirting. Well, that's not far from the truth. At the same time, most people notice only the smallest part of a brand's overall marketing strategy, with a limited perception of marketing. In most cases, people notice advertising, which today is mistakenly identified with overall marketing. However, what everyone "catches" and what they fall in love with is a good story, that is. storytelling. Similar to our hero from the beginning of the story.
 
 <br><br><strong>Why is it so? </strong>   
 <br><br>Simply put, people are surrounded by stories all their lives. Whether it’s fairy tales, bedtime stories, readings, daily news and the like, stories lead us to life lessons. They enrich our spirit. They make life more colorful and interesting.
 <br><br> <strong>5 rules of quality storytelling: </strong> 
 <br><br> <strong>Credibility  </strong>   
 <br><br>Ljubisa's rooster of 104 and a half kilos, dog Bobby pulling a tractor and bees from New Delhi carrying a cow have no business background. Maybe Ljubiša gets some more clients at his car wash, but the point of his stories is obvious. The man is a great storyteller and wants to make people happy. On the other hand, if we use storytelling methodology in business, the credibility of the story, ie its sincere intention and purpose are the most important element of success. Simply put, there is no lying. No cheating on our companions. There is no inventing something that your brand is not. Point. In addition, it is very important to point out what your brand stands for, what values ​​are important. Stories must be personal, human.
  <br><br> <strong>Methodology</strong>
  <br><br> Many who will read this text will say: "This is very simple, everyone can do it!" My opinion is - very difficult. The very methodology required by storytelling implies, first of all, defining a certain number of different types of stories that will be placed on the market. The difference is whether they are fun, educational, informative and the like. After that, it is necessary to define the most efficient media for the placement of our stories, and in accordance with the selected methods of placement to define the method of storytelling - written article, video article, photo or a combination thereof, etc. One of the storytelling articles that proved to be the most successful on social networks is the "review" article, ie a New Year's article about all the activities of our Nursery of old fruit varieties, from the moment of grafting to the moment of placing seedlings in the current year. People simply enjoy a combination of logically placed photos, with simple and connected descriptions that contain a warm human story. A story I can identify with (which brings us to the next rule).
  <br><br> <strong>Emotions</strong>
  <br><br>Let’s go back for a moment to our colleague Godin, who said that people don’t buy goods or services, but emotions. Every brand, which brings its customer, in addition to material benefits, also emotional ones, has succeeded. The same philosopher states that a brand is nothing but a set of memories, expectations, stories, emotions and connections, which together leave an impression on the customer and lead him to choose one product instead of another. People love human stories, the ones they can identify with. Now, it is a great skill to guess the story for each of our companions, however, no one asks us to. There are basic emotions and values ​​that all people identify with. An example of this are the recent events in our Nursery, related to the May floods. Our struggle to preserve 2,500 lives (not just humans and animals are living creatures and plants) has met with general enthusiasm and support. The story of our endeavor had a huge organic reach, and in a few days we received dozens of offers from the media to write about us, offers for cooperation, placement of seedlings and the like.
<br><br>
Type comments:
<br><br>
"All the best, good people. I'll talk to you in the fall to order these famous, resistant seedlings….
<br><br>
With a history of survival like this, this is a unique thing that everyone will want "or" I was really happy with this good news. I am so glad that you managed to save at least part of the seedlings. Great experience, but I hope you won't need it for a long time znači “means that you have succeeded.
<br><br>
Many have "fallen in love" with your brand. Your story must inspire. Your story has to fix someone’s day!
 <br><br> <strong>No sales!</strong>
 <br><br>A good product or service sells itself. This is the most important postulate of marketing, which, fortunately, everyone is familiar with. I believe that a quality storytelling methodology should not contain a direct invitation to buy, that is, it should not be directly of a sales nature. Much like sales should not be the goal of marketing activities, but their consequence. The goal is to create a "story" about you in the market that is transmitted organically from word of mouth with the quality of products and services, as well as quality information to the public about your activities. It is the pinnacle of every brand. Instead of a direct offer, it is necessary, where possible, to invite followers to "action", but again indirectly. <br><br> <strong>       Listening </strong>
 <br><br> If you have the opportunity, explore what your companions would like to hear, read, see and write about. Given that each brand builds around itself a "tribe" of companions who have common characteristics (needs and emotions), sometimes it is very easy to feel the desires of your companions. You just need to listen. In the process of designing the various attachments, we came up with the idea of ​​writing short reports on the custodians of old fruit varieties. As our companions are mostly lovers of organic fruit growing, based on old varieties, the mentioned contributions were a complete success! Sometimes a photograph of a producer under a massive sailing fruit tree, which preserves dozens of old varieties in an ecologically clean environment, in symbiosis with the animal world (bees, sheep, etc.) is more valuable than any certificate or confirmation of the organic quality of these foods.
<br><br>
In addition to the listed, basic principles that characterize quality storytelling, it is necessary to pay attention to the richness of vocabulary (see Ljubisa's adventures), always have a positive and cheerful tone, use humor subtly and with taste, where possible, do not spread unnecessary story and constantly introduce new stories and innovations (no repetition of old jokes). Also, creativity goes without saying, as does authenticity.
